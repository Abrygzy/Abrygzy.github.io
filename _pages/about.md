My name is Zeyu Gao (高泽宇). I am a PhD student in the [Department of Astronomy](http://vega.bac.pku.edu.cn/)/[KIAA](https://kiaa.pku.edu.cn/) at [Peking University](http://www.pku.edu.cn/). I am working with [Prof. Yingjie Peng](https://kiaa.pku.edu.cn/info/1010/1016.htm) on the topics of understanding the formation and evolution of galaxies through their SEDs. We developed a new SED fitting code with physical priors of evolution history information from cosmological hydrosimulations. We have released our data for the SDSS DR7 Spectroscopic sample in the [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/14209295), which includes stellar mass, star formation rate, and star formation history described by fractional formation times (T50, T70, T90). Take a look at our [paper](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2025ApJ...979...66G/abstract) for more details.

I am also interested in understanding galaxies through spatially resolved view. I worked with [Prof. Yanmei Chen](https://astronomy.nju.edu.cn/szll/szgk/js/20190816/i13833.html) with breathtakingly beautiful [MaNGA](https://www.sdss4.org/dr17/manga/) data. We found observational clues for different quenching mechanisms in the local universe.
