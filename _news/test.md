A new GitHub repository for SED fitting tricks.

---

黄齐丰 Qifeng Huang and I created a new [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Abrygzy/sed_fitting_tricks) to share our thoughts on SED fitting.
The idea is: SED fitting sometimes seems to be a black box to freshmen, and we want to share some tricks we learned from our own experience.
Everyone is welcome to contribute to this repository.
